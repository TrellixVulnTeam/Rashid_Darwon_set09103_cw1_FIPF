    "artistBio" : "He has appeared on his fellow Clan members solo projects, and since the release of his critically acclaimed solo album Liquid Swords (1995), he has maintained a successful solo career. He is considered to be one of the best MCs and lyricists because he is armed with sharp metaphors and a smooth flow, and has been noted for his lyrical style, which often dismisses typical rap story lines in favor of science and wide-ranging philosophies. An analysis of GZA's lyrics found that he has the second largest vocabulary in popular hip hop music.",

Liquid Swords features numerous guest appearances from the entire nine piece Wu-Tang Clan, and also Wu-Tang affiliate Killah Priest."

During the first round of solo projects, he made several appearances on tracks now considered Wu-Tang classics, such as Winter Warz, Duel of the Iron Mic, and Glaciers of Ice.

Even more remarkable is that, at a time when the Wu mostly seem like material for a future 'I Love the '90s' installment (Ghostface excepted), Masta Killa puts together an impressive album in the best tradition of the Clan: dusty, dissonant soul loops, lyrics that are all about style rather than shine, and that classic sinister quality embodied by the Wu's best albums.

Add to an impressive first album a list of producers, including MF Doom and Pete Rock, and it comes as no surprise that Killa's second outing has been eagerly awaited by hip hop fans. At a relatively lean 13 tracks, with no unfunny skits, Made In Brooklyn is a superior and taut addition to the Wu canon, which not even the risible cod reggae of Lovely Lady can detract from too much."

And as well respected as his lyrical flows on the Clan's tunes are, few could have guessed just what an awesome debut it would be. U-God, aka Golden Arms, has taken his time, left other Wu-members to build the hype and spent a year putting together some seriously arresting cuts. Together with the Clan's production supremo, RZA, he's concocted a funk-fuelled catalogue of up-lifting bass rumbles, tight and oppressive drum loops, 1970s horn samples and dark cop-show grooves to run against his raw, uncompromising rhymes.
